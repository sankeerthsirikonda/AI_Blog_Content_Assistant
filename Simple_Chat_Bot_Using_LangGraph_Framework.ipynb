            "\n",
            "- **Very High temperature (1.1-1.5):** This setting produces even more outlandish and humorous responses. It's great for entertainment purposes, like telling jokes or creating a funny story.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Extreme temperature (above 1.5):** This setting can lead to responses that are nonsensical or absurd. It's not usually recommended, as it can be difficult to understand or work with.\n",
